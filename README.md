# Task 3 – Text Generation with Markov Chains (CODECRAFT_GENAI_03)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple text generator using Markov Chains. It predicts the next word in a sequence based on previous words using probabilities from a sample input.

## Files
- `markov_text_generator.py` – main script
- `sample_input.txt` – the input text
- `README.md` – description

## How it works
1. It reads text from the file.
2. Builds a Markov chain dictionary.
3. Generates new text based on the chain.

## Output
Run the script to see generated random text that mimics the original style.
